                > i made this logo with the help of <a href="https://mattcolewilson.com/index.html" target="_blank">matt cole wilson</a> whose website was so fascinating that it made me learn html/css. art & design are very powerful. i know everyone else thought this already but i truly comprehended it recently. <br>
                <br>
                > i was worried about going for a more casual tone in this webbed site because my previous one was solely focused on making me seem like a Big Girl. but i realised it didn't matter as much as i thought and the work spoke for itself (questionable Big Girl). <br>
